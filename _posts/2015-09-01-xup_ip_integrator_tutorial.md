This tutorial guides you through the design flow using Xilinx Vivado software to create a simple digital circuit using Vivado IP Integrator (IPI). 


A typical design flow consists of creating a Vivado project, optionally setting a user-defined IP library settings, creating a block design using various IP, creating a HDL wrapper, creating and/or adding user constraint file(s), optionally running behavioral simulation, synthesizing the design, implementing the design, generating the bitstream, and finally verifying the functionality in the hardware by downloading the generated bitstream file. You will go through the typical design flow targeting the Artix-100t based Nexys4 or Artix-35t based Basys3 board.
