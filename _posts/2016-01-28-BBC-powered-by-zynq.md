title: Xilinx Zynq powering BBC radio data encoding
---

Being a commuter, I listen to my radio for almost 2 hours, 5 days a week. While sometimes I plug in my phone and listen to an audiobook, or podcast, the majority of the time I spend listening to the good *old-fashioned* FM radio channels. 

Apparenlty about 50% of millennials in the US listen to an average of 11 hrs of radio a week, like me, on their daily commute.

Have you ever considered what happens behind the scenes to delivery data directly to your car?

The BBC in the UK have provided some insight into some of the signals and systems that provide this service and how they recently upgraded their existing hardware, which dated back to 1983 to the Xilinx Zynq based Zedboard.
