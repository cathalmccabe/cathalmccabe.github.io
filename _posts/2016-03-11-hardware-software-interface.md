### Hardware Software Interface

Hardware Software Interface (HSI) is a scalable framework enabling embedded SW tool integration with Vivado. It enables third-party OS vendors and software providers to distribute
their software for Xilinx FPGA Platforms. HSI consumes hardware design (.hdf) files and the software repository (Drivers, OS, board support packages (BSPs), Libs, Apps, and DTG). It provides a rich set of Tcl APIs to access hardware information and to generate BSPs, Device Tree, and template applications.
