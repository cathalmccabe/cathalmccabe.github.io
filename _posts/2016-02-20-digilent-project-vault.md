Looking for some inspiration for your next FPGA project, or do you want to showcase your own work?
Check out the Digilent project vault:

The vault includes tutorials, guides, and projects from students, teachers, and hobbyist FPGA designers, with controbutions from Digilent.
 
Projects include stepper motor controllers, audio processing on Zynq, retro games (Tic-Tac-Toe, colour invaders), a HDL Fractal generator, data logging from FPGA to PC, an LED cube controller and many more.

Colour invaders is a fun game to play with an LED strip. You have a stream of invaders of a variety of colours marching up the LED strip. You need to match the colour of your missile (fired from the other end of the strip) to the color of the first invader:
 
The vault contains a wealth of useful IP that you can reuse to get started with your next design. e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe has a VGA controller, data logging shows how to transfer data from FPGA to PC, the fractal project has a HDMI out controller, HDMI in can be found in a Nexys 4 Video project, a range of PMOD drivers.
 
Some of the guides include Simulation with Vivado, PetaLinux, Vivado Logic Analyser Virtual IO and IP Integrator.
