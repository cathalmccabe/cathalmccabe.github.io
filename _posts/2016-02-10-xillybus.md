Xillybus provide IP to allow you to simplify data transfer between your host PC and an FPGA over a datatbus (e.g. PCIe, AXI). The Xillybus IP and drivers expose a simple FIFO interface to FPGA logic, and allow reading and writing of simple device files from the host PC Operating System (support for Linux, Windows), and provide a simple FIFO interface to the FPGA logic.

Xillybus also have a list of great tutorials that are not specific to Xillybus, including information on how PCIe works, an in-depth tutorial on the Linux Device Tree and using U-Boot, and a range of other material. You can find the tutorials here:
