Communication between FPGA and a host PC is  one of the most frequently asked questions by new FPGA users. While GPIO, UART are simple solutions for low performance designs, depending on the application requirements, high performance communication between FPGA and a host PC is typically non-trivial.  

Xillybus offer an off-the shelf solution by providing IP to allow you to simplify data transfer between your host PC and an FPGA over a datatbus (e.g. PCIe, AXI). The Xillybus IP and drivers expose a simple FIFO interface to FPGA logic, and allow reading and writing of simple device files from the host PC Operating System (support for Linux, Windows), and provide a simple FIFO interface to the FPGA logic.

# Tutorials 
Xillybus also have a list of great tutorials that are not specific to Xillybus. E.g.Information on how PCIe works, an in-depth tutorial on the Linux Device Tree, Using U-Boot, and a range of other material is available in the (Tutorials section of the Xillybus website)[http://xillybus.com/tutorials]
