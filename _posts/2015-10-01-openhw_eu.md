The Xilinx Open Hardware Design Contest 2016 has been launched, and gives students the opportunity to showcase their technical and creative skills.
 
Following on from the success of last year, there are two project categories, open to undergraduate and post graduate students; Embedded Design and Digital design. 
Cash prizes will be awarded to the best PhD, and under-graduate project in each category.
