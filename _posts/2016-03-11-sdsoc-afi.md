ACP is the accelerator coherency port - connected dirrectly to the processor caches.

AFI is an Asynchronous FIFO Interface (AFI) which exist on the Zynq HP ports (HP 0- 4). The HP ports have a dedicated 1K FIFO.

*If using the ACP port, the processor and Hardware function share access the same fast cache memory.
*If using a AFI/HP port, the software driver for the accelerator must flush the cache to DDR before the Hardware function can read the data from DDR.
*If using the GP ports, the processor directly writes/reads data to/from hardware function. This is inefficient for large data transfers.

See [AFI in SDSoC documentation](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2015_2/sdsoc_doc/topics/tutorials/concept_working_system_optimization.html)
