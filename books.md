### The Zynq Book
![Zynq Book](../images/books/zynq_book.jpg "Zynq Book")

Available as hardcopy, or free eBook.
The Zynq Book is the first book about Zynq to be written in the English language. We wanted to create an accessible, readable book that would benefit people just starting out with Zynq, and engineers already working with Zynq. We hope that it will prove a handy reference that remains on your desktop!
